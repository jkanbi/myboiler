Reconditioned Spare Parts
February 18, 2014 - 4:59 pm
 
Boilers are mechanical appliances and will go wrong time to time. Those unfortunate to have to pay repair costs for out of warranty boilers know that the costs can easily end up in the hundreds of pounds including labour and parts.

Many owners donâ€™t care one way or another just as long as their boiler is fixed at any cost. However in this day and age of tight finances, maintenance costs need to be kept as low as possible to pay for more important essentials such as food. So for the rest of the people on tight finances, reconditioned parts are available for boilers, which can also come with 1 year guarantees. The cost of reconditioned parts can be a fraction of the cost of new parts. So it can pay to fit reconditioned parts. However as with all non new parts there is a risk of early failure in which the part might be guaranteed but the cost of labour may still be applicable. So things have to be balanced up in a cost versus risk manner that is carried out with many things in life.

A good idea when repairing appliances is to have a cut off point where you say I will spend only X amount of pounds before deciding to replace the entire appliance.  As nowadays some manufacturers provide upto 10 years of guarantee on their boilers.

 

Boiler Cover / Insurance
Alternatively for those unable to purchase new systems, it would be a wise decision to put a regular amount of money away each month for future maintenance or purchase suitable breakdown cover. Please note some home insurers include boiler breakdown insurance in their policies so you may not have to get separate cover. Following are some Heating Breakdown Cover Insurance companies(more will be added in due course):
