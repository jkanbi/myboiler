It has been an EU requirement from 1st January 2013 that all central heating pumps sold, be energy ‘A rated’. It is believed older in-efficient pumps / circulators are responsible for upto 20% of electric energy bills in certain households. These new ‘A rated’ pumps can save upto 80% compared to non ‘A rated’ models.

Many of these newer pumps are also self modulating and self maintaining to a degree that they are more intelligent and can detect required performance to match the system. The technology these types of pump use, is known as variable speed drive. It’s what allows them to be more efficient than fixed speed pumps. They work more like a human heart does, with the ability to regulate as and when needed to cope with demand.

Fitted with thermostatic radiator valves(TRVs) and set correctly, these pumps can run as low as 3W of power. The lowest most standard domestic non ‘A rated’ models run at, is approx 35-50W. That’s a big saving if your at the lowest requirement.

There are quite a few different makes available , however the two generally accepted major brands are Grundfos and Wilo. These two brands make up majority of the domestic central heating pump/circulator market.
