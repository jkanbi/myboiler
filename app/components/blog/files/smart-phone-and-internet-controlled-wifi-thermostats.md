This thermostat is the latest offering by UK based Heatmiser. Heatmiser commonly manufacturers heating controls for a few other well known brands. It will also be able to link to other systems by the way of it’s expandable design and API and so will quite possibly be futureproofed. Eg. If  your smartphone detects you are on your way home it can tell your heating system to come on  in time, ready for you. The thermostat needs to be  installed by a suitably qualified person.

There are two kits available as well as seperate components. Neokit1 is purely for controlling one central heating zone from your smart phone via Heatmiser’s app. The Neokit2 is for controlling one central heating zone and hot water zone, allowing you to also control when your hot water comes on and off.

Nest Thermostat
Nest


This thermostat is created by ex-Apple engineers and so has a very Apple feel to it. It is designed to be very intelligent, in that it is able to connect to the internet to determine the weather conditions in the area it is installed in and adjust it’s performance accordingly. It also takes input from the home occupants to build up a pattern of when heating is required, so after a  few weeks of learning it will automatically work out the best settings for you. This thermostat is able to be controlled from your smart phone from home and anywhere you have internet connectivity.

The future of this thermostat will be to link to other home devices including Nest’s intelligent Smoke Alarm to determine when people are home and in which rooms, so heating can be directed to the most used rooms. The Nest Thermostat is due to launch in the UK very soon after voltage issues, as the UK works commonly at different voltages compared to the US systems.

UPDATE 02/04/2014:  The Nest thermostat is now released for the UK Market.

This intelligent thermostat detects the home occupiers smart phones and knows when the last person has left or the first person has arrived back into the house, so then it activates the heating system. This thermostat has similarities to the Nest thermostat, in that it checks weather forecasts and current weather conditions to determine weather the heating system needs to come on or not.

The Tado is available for monthly rental of £6.99 or a one off cost of £249.
