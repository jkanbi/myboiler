Commonly in the medical profession they say ‘prevention is better than a cure’, well this saying applies across many areas of life including plumbing and heating systems.  So making sure your system is clear and protected in the first place, is the most important way of preventing premature failure of components.

During yearly maintenance, your engineer should be able to test levels of protection in your system and demonstrate to you visibly using a chemical test that your system contains sufficient inhibitor levels. Ideally your central heating water should be clear as well. Otherwise you may require a powerflush. Also to note, is that some systems are designed incorrectly either due to it being installed a long time ago when standards did not exist or due to incompetent installers. You must correct this problems otherwise inhibitors could be made ineffective.

Another  routinely common  method of system / boiler protections  is the usage of a magnetic or dirt filter.

Following are  anti rusting inhibitors available to put in your central heating system:
