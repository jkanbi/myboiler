Magnetic and Dirt Filter protect the boiler and system components from  magnetite and sludge that it produced as a byproduct of system corrosion. Other particles can also be circulating around in the system depending on how clean it is, the inhibitor levels in the system and installation problems.

There are two types of filter. One that catches magnetic/ ferrous debris and the other that catches non-magnetic/ non-ferrous debris. The central heating system filter market is now relatively mature and dominated by a few major brands and also several alternative brands. Some of these filters also allow you to clean them yourself with very little effort or you can let your engineer clean them at the same time as a yearly service.

Following are some commonly used central heating filters:

Fernox TF1 Magnaclean Pro2 MB3_magnet_slide_72dpi_563x1024px_E-500x500

 

 

The first one is the Fernox TF1, the second is the Magnaclean Professional 2, and the third is the Spirotech Magnabooster 3 . These particular filters catch all types of dirt however some of them have different volumes of how much dirt they can capture. However we believe in a clean and upto standard system, there should not be much yearly corrosion produced to fill these  filters up.

The filters are available from your local plumbers merchants or the following online retailers:
