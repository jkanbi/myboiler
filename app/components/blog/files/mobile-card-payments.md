Following are three different pay as you go mobile payment terminals available quickly and setup very quickly too. Please note smartphone/tablet with internet connection required.

This terminal costs £99 and has a standard 2.75% fee on all transactions. The money is deposited directly into your paypal account. From there you are able to withdraw to your bank account.

Pros : Paypal Here has also built in functionality for invoicing — It has a facility to scan barcodes using your smart phone camera — It has facility to store commonly sold products and services with their prices so you can quickly enter products. Accepts chip and pin. Links with existing paypal accounts — Can be used with more than one paypal account.

Cons: It little more costly than other readers of better design — The card terminal itself does not have an LCD screen telling you what to do or whether the battery is dying or dead — So in some respects it’s a very blind terminal even though your smartphone/pda does most of the work.
