Power Flushing of Wet Central Heating Systems
February 15, 2014 - 11:59 am
 
Power flushing is the process of using a high flow low pressure power flush machine with chemicals to remove debris,rust, contaminants etc from central heating systems. This form of flushing does not cause damage to your system when carried out properly, however problems may  arise due to pre-existing problems that exist within the system.

The benefits of powerflushing are not always clear to home owners. There are some energy savings that happen after flushing, due to the boiler not having to burn as much fuel to heat radiators lined with corrosion debris. The most important benefit of power flushing and good system anti corrosion inhibitors, is that it prevents the premature breakdown of components. Fixing broken components could cost you more than a powerflush and in some cases require you to replace a boiler costing £1000 upwards.

Benefits of having a power flush done:

	Increased Efficiency due to removal of sludge that lines the system
	Increased System Life
	Increase System Reliability
	Increased Energy Savings
Signs that you may need powerflushing:

	Radiators cold at the bottom,
	Boiler cuts out or makes kettle type noises
	Cold home or radiators not working due to blocked pipes
	Gas bills are higher even though the rates are the same and the usage is the same.
