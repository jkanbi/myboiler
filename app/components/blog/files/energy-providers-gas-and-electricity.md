Are you looking for the best energy provider to switch to? Well in this post we cover the best sites to get the best energy provider for your needs and other methods to reduce your energy costs. After all, your appliance can be running near it’s maximum efficiency however you can still be paying more in energy costs than your neighbour who has the same appliance and same usage, but with a very good energy supplier.

Reducing your energy usage is your first priority. As the saying goes, ‘the cheapest energy is energy that you don’t use’.  So the most simplest way to do this is to **turn things off** when not using them. The next step, you then start using good quality controls that automate the switching on and off of appliances, ie timers that make sure appliances come on when needed; roomstats or limit controls that make sure once something comes on that it doesn’t continue to stay on after the demand has been satisfied.

After implementing energy saving controls you then need to make sure you are on the cheapest or most suitable tariff for your needs. There are now many comparison sites on the internet that show you the best tariffs for you after you have entered your energy usage information. Below are some of these comparison sites and also some energy providers approved by us for you to use, to switch providers.
